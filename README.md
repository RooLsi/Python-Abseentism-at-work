However, this costs companies in terms of loss of productivity, quality of work and financially. There are several reasons for absenteeism which include from high competitiveness, increasingly audacious goals, overburdening work which may lead to many health conditions. The purpose of this paper is present different machine learning techniques that can be applied to predict reasons for absenteeism at work. Random Forest, Linear Regression, Naïve Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machine (linear, radial and poly) techniques were used in this paper.
